		<h2>Our Objective</h2>
		<p>
			With this particular project we aim to collect data entered
			by the user, store it and later study or analyze. We have tried
			to create list of questions which are field relevant and can
			hopefully, be useful in knowing about preferences of the user 
			who accessing our website and is taking the survey. The contact 
			details which is asked before the survey are for internal
			purpose only and is stored in secure database and not sold to
			third parties whatsover. The database we aim to create can be
			repurposed again later and further be worked on and differentiated 
			and sorted according to the choices filled in by the user and an 
			intelligent self sufficient system or program can be designed to 
			take users to particular website or provide them with relevant 
			resources should they wnat to read or know about.
