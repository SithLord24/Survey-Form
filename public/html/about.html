			<p class="about">
				We are currently undergrads at Chandigarh University.<br>
				We are training ourself in Web Development and Database<br>
				Management. This Survey-Form is a result of project<br> 
				assigned to us. We aim to learn more about scripting <br> 
				languages and special effects which are common on any <br>
				modern website, also we plan to learn other Web Development <br>
				practices. Since, Web Development is really important <br>
				skill a developer can have in his arsenal, we believe <br>
				everyone should learn or at least try this, and thus <br>
				we also have provided links to resources we learned <br>
				from and found useful while creating this project.
